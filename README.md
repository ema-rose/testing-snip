### testing snippet repository

This is an example of how a repo may be set up to function as a snippet library.

The above folder structure is just one example. Personally, this is how I would find it most useful. A code at the beginning of the file to indicate the language (which will auto sort), then a category.   

However, you can also set it up by category (connection, dataframes, etc), then have language folders within those category folders. Or, the opposite where you divide by language and subdivide by category.
